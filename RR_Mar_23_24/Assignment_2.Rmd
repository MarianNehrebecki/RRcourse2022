#### The viewership over time




```{r, include=F}
library(ggplot2)
```


```{r viewers_plot1, fig.align='center', echo=F}
data <- data.frame(Time = c(2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017),
                   Viewers = c(6.69, 8.08, 8.08, 8.42, 8.24, 8.68, 8.15, 7.02, 7.28))



ggplot(data, aes(x = as.factor(Time), y = Viewers)) +
  geom_col(position = "stack",
           fill = "lightgreen") +
  geom_text(aes(label = Viewers)) +
  labs(x = "Years",
       y = "Viewers (in millions)",
       title = "Figure 1. Viewers in (millions) by years"
            )
```

**Comments:** 

1. In `r data[data$Viewers==max(data$Viewers),]$Time` was the highest number of viewers and equal `r max(data$Viewers)` in millions.

2. The viewership decreased by  `r max(data$Viewers) - min(data$Viewers)` in millions
between `r data[data$Viewers==max(data$Viewers),]$Time` and `r data[data$Viewers==min(data$Viewers),]$Time` years.

#### The viewership over season




```{r viewers_plot2, fig.align='center', echo=F}
data <- data.frame(Season = 1:9,
                   Viewers = c(6.69, 8.08, 8.08, 8.42, 8.24, 8.68, 8.15, 7.02, 7.28))



ggplot(data, aes(x = as.factor(Season), y = Viewers)) +
  geom_col(position = "stack",
           fill = "grey") +
  geom_text(aes(label = Viewers)) +
  labs(x = "Season",
       y = "Viewers (in millions)",
       title = "Figure 2. Viewers in (millions) by seasons"
            )
```


**Comments:**

1. The average number of viewers was `r round(mean(data$Viewers),2)` in millions.

2. The median number of viewers was `r median(data$Viewers)` in millions.
